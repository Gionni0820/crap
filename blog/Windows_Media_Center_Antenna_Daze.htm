          <p>We begin here. On my first blog post... Well I guess that's a good thing right? Anyways back in the early days of 2020, I found my way into <b>Windows Media Center</b>, a application designed by Microsoft to play media, watch and record television and more! </p>
          <p>Now of course reading this. You might understand that Microsoft discontinued their <i>Electronic Program Guide Service</i> in which is where service data and guide data comes from. I had to resort to some other provider. (Goodness I wish I wasn't so LATE to this whole WMC stuff...) The provider I resorted to was <b>EPG123</b>. An alternative service to get EPG data functioning on Windows Media Center after the deadline of discontinuation.</p>
  <br>
          <img style="border-radius: 10%; display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 4px; align-items: center; width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;"src="../Media/IMG_5167.JPG" alt="Working Windows Media Center on XBOX 360 Extender as of May 3, 2020.">
<br>
   <p>Since I was new to all of this shabang of modifying a pre-existing system of things. (I did mod a Wii 3 years prior to this) I was new and of course skeptical. I was a "virus-aphobe" in which I of course had a history of getting virus'. Specifically on this machine I used. The machine I used was a <b>Gateway DX4300</b> and a <b>AVerMedia PCI-e M791-A</b> (I think) for the ATSC signaling. Now to ask the question? <i>Have I actually used any form of machinary like this? More-so, have I ever used Windows Media Center in my time owning this desktop at all?</i> Well to answer that question, no. Installing a PCI-e card is not at all hard at all. At least for me. Though for Media Center, I probably went on it a couple of times when I would be on my Animal Jam / ROBLOX daily phase. I did get the desktop in mid-2016 as a surprise since I used our "computer room" desktop quite often. Then from there landed me with this piece of machinary I still have and slightly use to this day.</p>
<br>
<p>Aside the information about what I used and a bit of my story about the desktop I used. The setup process for EPG123 was fairly simple, you would need to run the installer and it would do everything for you. There are some limitations though. The service isn't necessarly <i>free</i>... I know, but if you like a solid service, I paid for it. <b>SchedulesDirect</b> (listed on the setup process for EPG123) is the data provider for the application to bring you your EPG to media center. It's good for what it is. Nothing to it except that.</p>
<br>
<p>Getting all of that setup, EPG123 requires a scan for TV signals (devices like the ATSC TV tuner or a CableCARD compliant device.) then it will finish up everything. You can customize whats suited for your needs. Such as grid size and file output customization. Now I was the type who wanted a niche output for my media center experience. I wanted matching colors logos for the channels. I resorted to the freeware application <b>MyChannelLogos</b> (which is safe.) Is an application that allows for customization such as setting a logo type, big or small and the main thing to import a custom logo. I preferred all white logos (shown in the picture above) to make things match. I customized and made logos white in <i>Google Drawings</i> (I didn't have any crazy editing software ok.) and made it suitable and fit my needs. It was great for me, but not my machine. With many processes running such as the EPG123 client and MyChannelLogos, there were frequently times WMC would crash. Keep in mind I was running all of this on a WIndows 7 Professional x64 with 2GB of DDR2 RAM. Hence the machine being old, it wasn't presistant with processing all of this. It's just how things work.</p>

<h3 style="color: black; font-size: 50px;">The Antenna Experimenting</h3>
<br> 
<p>A major part of my time playing and using Windows Media Center was the part of uh. Television recieving! And it was a rough ride. In 2020, at least since late 2017. We didn't have cable, not even cable internet. We has DSL with AT&T. Though there was antenna television! Known as OTA or ATSC in whichever you call it. Though in my time of using WMC, I <i>needed</i> all of the channels I can get in my area but how would I actually get it? With an antenna of course! Though it's not easy like that. While being in the primative state of understanding antenna. A lowsy flat antenna wouldn't work. I wanted PBS Kids! The station I wanted was on a VHF signal and that antenna was better with UHF with recieving CBS and ION (at the time qubo existed) it was what I can only get and well I had to get creative.</p>

<br> 
<p>I shall name it this. And yeah this is what really happened. I eventually later on had the option to plug in an antenna to the cable input on the side of my house and get better reception on channels besides whatever the heck this is. Though all of this just to get channels. Whenever I wanted to record a program. I would need to leave my room to prevent interference. It was THAT bad. Now today I have the capability to mount a better antenna if I wanted to but I have cable so I don't care anymore. I still use an antenna to this day connected to our living room TiVo Premiere with cable for channels you don't normally get on cable. Though I learned a lot from this and well yeah.</p>
<br>
<p>Though overall, is Windows Media Center for beginners? I can't say no but it's good for working with for fun I guess. Though I prefer a TiVo without having to run a computer all night making your room super hot. But WMC is a great alternative. You need to buy yourself a capture card. But buy the right one, anyone doesn't work. I suggest you check this service out for more information <a href="https://garyan2.github.io/" target="_blank">EPG123</a>, its a great alt service for recieving EPG data. You could also use WMC without it but just set manual recordings. It works alright hut you're missing the chance of getting correct data. My time with WMC is up. It's reliable for recording needs but it's not suitable for watching it live directly unless you have a proper setup. My experience was fine i'll rate it. But before TiVo, this is what I used if you're interested. I learned a lot from it. During 2023 I proceeded to bring the desktop back up and use cable with it. Same stuff but i'll talk about that a different time.</p>
